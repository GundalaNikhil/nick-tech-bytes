# Knight Dialer

## Problem Description

**Real-World Scenario:**
A security keypad analysis determines how many distinct PIN codes of length N can be generated by a knight moving on a phone pad.

**Example Setup:** 
A chess puzzle counts the number of valid knight paths of length N on a specific board configuration.

**What is Knight Dialer?**
The chess knight has a unique movement, it may move two squares vertically and one square horizontally, or two squares horizontally and one square vertically (with both forming the shape of an L). Given an integer `n`, return how many distinct phone numbers of length `n` we can dial. You are allowed to place the knight on any numeric cell initially and then you should perform `n - 1` jumps to dial a number of length `n`. All jumps should be valid knight jumps. Return the answer modulo 10^9 + 7.

**Why is it important?**
- Graph DP / Matrix Exponentiation
- State transitions
- Modulo arithmetic
- Path counting

**Your Task:** 
Return the count of distinct numbers.

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Tags:** Dynamic Programming, Grid Dp, Graph Dp / Matrix Exponentiation, State Transitions, Modulo Arithmetic, Path Counting, O(n), Interview

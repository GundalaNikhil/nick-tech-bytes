# Concatenated Words

## Problem Description

**Real-World Scenario:**
A dictionary analysis tool identifies compound words that are formed entirely by combining other shorter words from the same dictionary.

**Example Setup:** 
A language learning app highlights "supercalifragilisticexpialidocious" if it's composed of smaller valid words in the database.

**What is Concatenated Words?**
Given an array of strings `words` (without duplicates), return all the concatenated words in the given list of words. A concatenated word is defined as a string that is comprised entirely of at least two shorter words in the given array.

**Why is it important?**
- DP / DFS with Memoization
- Trie optimization
- String composition
- Hard interview problem

**Your Task:** 
Return list of concatenated words.

## Examples

### Example 1:
**Input:** `words = ["cat","cats","catsdogcats","dog","dogcatsdog","hippopotamuses","rat","ratcatdogcat"]`
**Output:** `["catsdogcats","dogcatsdog","ratcatdogcat"]`
**Explanation:** "catsdogcats" = "cats"+"dog"+"cats".

### Example 2:
**Input:** `words = ["cat","dog","catdog"]`
**Output:** `["catdog"]`

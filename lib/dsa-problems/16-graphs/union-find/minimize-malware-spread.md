# Minimize Malware Spread

## Problem Description

**Real-World Scenario:**
A cybersecurity analyst identifies which single infected computer to patch to minimize the final number of infected computers in a network, given that malware spreads between connected nodes.

**Example Setup:** 
A public health official decides which single patient to quarantine to minimize the total spread of a virus in a community network.

**What is Minimize Malware Spread?**
Given an adjacency matrix `graph` and an array `initial` of infected nodes. If you remove one node from `initial`, the malware spread (connected component size) is minimized. Return the node that, if removed, minimizes the final number of infected nodes.

**Why is it important?**
- Union-Find / DFS
- Connected Components
- Impact analysis
- Graph theory application

**Your Task:** 
Return the node index to remove.

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Tags:** Graphs, Union Find, Union-Find / Dfs, Connected Components, Impact Analysis, Graph Theory Application, O(N²), Interview

## Examples

### Example 1:
**Input:** `graph = [[1,1,0],[1,1,0],[0,0,1]], initial = [0,1]`
**Output:** `0`
**Explanation:** Removing 0 leaves 1 infected. Component {0,1} still infected. Removing 1 leaves 0 infected. Tie. Return smaller index.

### Example 2:
**Input:** `graph = [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,1]], initial = [0,2]`
**Output:** `0`
**Explanation:** Components are isolated. Removing 0 saves component {0}. Removing 2 saves component {2}. Tie.

### Example 3:
**Input:** `graph = [[1,1,1],[1,1,1],[1,1,1]], initial = [1,2]`
**Output:** `1`
**Explanation:** All connected. Removing 1 leaves 2 infected, so all get infected. Removing 2 leaves 1 infected, so all get infected. Tie.

## Follow-up Questions

1. Why use Union-Find to group components?
2. How to count how many initial infected nodes are in each component?
3. Why only consider components with exactly 1 infected node?
4. What if we could remove k nodes?

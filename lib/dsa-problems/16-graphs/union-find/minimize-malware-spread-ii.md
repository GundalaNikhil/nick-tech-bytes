# Minimize Malware Spread II

## Problem Description

**Real-World Scenario:**
A cybersecurity analyst identifies the single most critical infected node to remove from a network to minimize the final spread of a virus, assuming the virus spreads to all reachable nodes.

**Example Setup:** 
A social network moderator bans one bot account to minimize the reach of a misinformation campaign.

**What is Minimize Malware Spread II?**
You are given a network of `n` nodes represented as an `n x n` adjacency matrix `graph`, where the `ith` node is directly connected to the `jth` node if `graph[i][j] == 1`. Some nodes `initial` are initially infected by malware. Whenever two nodes are directly connected and at least one of those two nodes is infected by malware, both nodes will be infected by malware. This spread of malware will continue until no more nodes can be infected in this manner. Suppose `M(initial)` is the final number of nodes infected with malware in the entire network, after the spread of malware stops. We will remove one node from the initial infected list, completely removing it and any connections from this node to any other node. Return the node that if removed, would minimize `M(initial)`. If multiple nodes could be removed to minimize `M(initial)`, return such a node with the smallest index.

**Why is it important?**
- Union-Find / DFS
- Component Analysis
- Graph Connectivity
- Optimization

**Your Task:** 
Return the node index.

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Tags:** Graphs, Union Find, Union-Find / Dfs, Component Analysis, Graph Connectivity, Optimization, O(N^2), Interview

## Examples

### Example 1:
**Input:** `graph = [[1,1,0],[1,1,0],[0,0,1]], initial = [0,1]`
**Output:** `0`
**Explanation:** 
Remove 0: 1 is infected. 1 infects 0? No, 0 removed. 1 infects nothing else. Total 1.
Remove 1: 0 is infected. 0 infects 1? No. Total 1.
Tie, return smallest index 0.

### Example 2:
**Input:** `graph = [[1,1,0],[1,1,1],[0,1,1]], initial = [0,1]`
**Output:** `1`
**Explanation:** 
Remove 0: 1 infects 2. Total 2.
Remove 1: 0 infects nothing. Total 1.
Return 1.

## Follow-up Questions

1. How is this different from Malware Spread I (node removal vs source removal)?
2. Why analyze components of non-infected nodes?
3. For each component, which infected nodes are connected to it?
4. If a component is connected to exactly one infected node, removing that node saves the component. Why?
